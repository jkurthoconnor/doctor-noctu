## A Vim color scheme for 16-color terminals

This is a _fork_of vim-noctu; it is currently under development and unlikely to be in a consistent state . 

If you are looking for the original `noctu.vim` color scheme, you'll find the latest version in the [author's][1] GitHub [repository][2]. If you're looking for a color scheme for GUI Vim, you may be interested in [Hemisu][3], also by the Noah Frederick.

The purpose of the project hasn't changed from the original author's intent:

> Rather than specifying particular color values for Vim, I prefer to have consistent colors across
*all* software that I use in the terminal... [Thus] this scheme is restricted to 16
ANSI colors (0 through 15), the representation of which can be redefined by
configuring your terminal emulator. This means that you can change your color
scheme "globally" without having to edit this script.
